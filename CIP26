Abstract
Add the function LOCK ASSET DESCRIPTION 

Motivation
Remove the possiblitly for asset owners to "rug" the image or other data connected with a counterparty asset

Rationale
While it is good to be able to change an asset description to update broken links and other technical issues in many cases a permanent as possble option for the asset description is wanted.
Most people that own counterparty assets asume this is already the case, that the description is permanent. This would allow the -option- for asset owners to LOCK the description for all blockchain eternity.

Specification
Not 100% sure but just copy and paste the code from lock issuance and put jam it in the description area so it works

Example use cases
Theo creates an asset pointing to imgr,ipfs,inscription or base64 as description. After LOCK DESCRIPTION it is no longer possible to change the description
